1.	To visualize the original series.
2.	To identify the missing values and fill them using an appropriate method.
3.	To identify the outliers present and normalize their values.
4.	To create and visualize the respective weekly and monthly series.
5.	To decompose the monthly series and visualize its trend and seasonal components.
6.	To compute the average sales per weekday and month

Exercise B. The second series of the dataset presents the daily sales of a product sold in the store, 
expressed in units. You are asked:
